All results shown here are from Run10 200GeV Au+Au collisions. Full TPC+TOF PID

balance_kaon
	- This directory contains data for Fig 6.33 of my thesis. It is all inclusive kaon balance function results. "raw_data" is the balance function from data, "sample_shuffled" is the shuffled events, "mixed" is the mixed events, "subtract_mixed" is raw_data - mixed events. In each folder, the balance function data are stored in "balance_0.txt" to "balance_8.txt", which represent centrality 0-5% to 70-80%, please ignore "balance_9.txt". "draw_balance_kaons_all_sample.C" is the sample code to read the data and make Fig 6.33

balance_kaon_remove_phi
	- This is for figure 6.36

balance_proton
	- This is for figure 6.37. Similar to directory "balance_kaon"

balance_pion
	- This is pion balance function. The data was not in my thesis. Actually, only 0-5% and 70-80% data have been shown publicly previously. The rest centralities was only shown inside STAR. For reference, please see my QM12 poster
