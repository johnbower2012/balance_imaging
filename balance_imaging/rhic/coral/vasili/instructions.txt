Hi Vasili,

First untar/unzip trunk.tar.gz and put the directory "trunk" somewhere convenient. This is the CorAL distribution.

Also untar/unzip the file vasili.tar.gz. This is the working space, and has the files you should normally have to edit to work.

Before you run code you must install:
A. scons   -- this is a "make" replacement based on python. It is a pain in the ass, and I wish I had just used make, but this is what we have
B. GSL -- the GNU scientific library

You must make some definitions of environment variables. In bash,

export CORAL_GSLPATH=/usr/local/
export CORAL_HOME=/Users/vasili/CorAL/trunk/
export CORAL_CCFLAGS=-O2 -fast
export CORAL_X11PATH=/usr/X11R6/           You shouldn't need this one
Of course, if you unpack CorAL somewhere else, or if GSL is installed somewhere else, you need to change the variables.

Sometimes the OSCAR formats differ, and you have to edit the CorAL code so that it is read correctly. If you have to do this, the file is 
.../src/SourceCalc/sourcecalc_OSCAR.cc
You might have to change the number of dummy lines, or add or edit the variables read in on  a given line

FILES in vasili/

SCconstruct
	This is like a makefile. To compile everything you should just type "scons"

cfmaker3d_oscar.cc  and cfmaker3d_oscar_fullwf.cc
	These makes 3-d correlation functions. Read the beginnings of the files for more info. You will 
	undoubtedly have to edit these files
	
sourcefit_3dgaussian.cc and sourcefit_3dgaussian_fullwf.cc
	These find the Gaussian radii Rout=Rx, Rside=Ry and Rlong=Rz. Results are written to
	results/results3d.dat or results/results3d_fullwf.dat respectively.
	These use Newton's methods, which may or may not work. You might try changing initial radii and lambda,
	or you might prefer to use your own fitting programs all-together. If you want to fit the full-wf CFs
	with Bowler-Sinyukov corrected Gaussians, you can set the calc flag to 10 in
	sourcefit_3dgaussian_fullwf.cc. If you do BS, you may want to go to .../trunk/src/Source2CF/source2cf.cc 
	and edit the routine S2CF::s2c_bowlersinyukov and change the parameter Rbar, which is currently set 
	to 5.0 fm, to be consistent with RHIC experiments

Good luck and keep me posted as to whether you can get the stuff to compile/run/work
